### CPSC 120

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 1 even though was recent was one of my favorites as it created a simple yet complex challange for us to code. I was able to write many new functions and variables using new packages like Magick to process images and make them into a simple animated gif. The complexity of using two functions to go through the colors to generate a cool image.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 2 was another favorite as the end result showed a cool imagery produced from the new lines generated and adding to the picture generated. It was a simple procedure using a mix of lines, dashes, and asteriks to create a picture. However it was still a fun challange on deciding on how to space the new lines for the others to generate around it.

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 1 was my last favorite as I go to the gym frequently so calculating something simple as our bmr was cool to see what calories we should maintain. It was the start of using simple variables we know like double which was fun to write and debug. It was also not too challenging which made this part fun to make the many functions in this lab.
